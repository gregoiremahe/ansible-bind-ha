# ## Configure ip variable to clusterize your bind9 servers.
# ##    It's better if this IP is from a private subnet (i.e. 10.0.0.0/8; 172.16.0.0/16 or 192.168.1.0/24), as the zone transfer will be done from this IP
# ##    Can be the same ip as the default iface
# ## Configure zoneip variable to create A record into your default zone.
# ##    You can create a A record to that IP for you nameserver.
# ##    Should be public IP, except if you wants to provision dns servers for your local network
